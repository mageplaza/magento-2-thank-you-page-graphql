# Magento 2 Thank You Page GraphQL / PWA

Mageplaza Thank You Page is such a great extension for your business. **It’s now more useful with GraphQL integration. In more details, Magento 2 Thank You Page GraphQL is already a part of the Mageplaza Thank You Page extension that adds GraphQL features. This also supports PWA compatibility with more flexibility in future updates.**

[Mageplaza Thank You Page for Magento 2](https://www.mageplaza.com/magento-2-thank-you-page/) is a useful tool to please your customers after placing an order or completing any action on your store. It beautifies your Thank You Page and creates a “happy experience” for your customers. 

From the admin backend, you can make any changes on the Order Success Page and Newsletter Success Page. All the content of both pages, including page title, subtitle, and description can be customized to your preferences and purposes. Besides the default style, you can choose to use different visually-attractive styles for your pages to make them more unique. By the flexibility of customizing, you can equip your pages with extra functions and contents by adding Order details, social sharing buttons, and more. This feature allows you to turn your Thank You Page into a content-rich page that can be used for promotional purposes as well. 
In particular, the order details on the Success Page is a helpful overview of what customers have purchased. They will see the essential information, including order information, billing address, and shipping method, which will once more solidify their purchasing decisions and confirm their successful order and checkout.

By enabling social sharing on the Thank You Page, you are making it right to get promoted by your customers with satisfaction on their minds. This can draw new visitors and conversions to your pages. A newsletter subscription box will be added to your Thank You Page so that you can collect customers' emails and stimulate them into your newsletter subscription. This is of the essence to keep in touch with your customers and retain them. 

Besides, you can also add a product slider to your Thank You Page for cross-selling. Based on your customers’ purchases, recommend them relevant products that they might be interested in and willing to pay for. Your cross-selling products should not be too expensive so that they can be noticed and collected by your customers. You can freely set the title for your related product block as long as it’s appealing to your customers. 

Moreover, the extension enables offering coupons right on the Thank You Page, which is a wise way to entice customers to purchase more. Another outstanding feature is that it allows you to show a FAQs section that provides more information for customers when they need.
